# Hi there :wave:
I'm a keen techie with a passion for all things computers! I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at Queen's University Belfast.

* I'm particularly interested in **C/C++**, **Java**, **Linux**, **networking** and **doing things efficiently**.
* I've spent a year working with **ReactJS** on my placement and have worked with **machine learning** tech and **malware** over the last year of university.
* In my free time I'm currently working on several projects including an **Android** game using **libgdx** and **netty** with some nice physics and client-server architecture. I might want to do something with this in the future so details are kinda *hush-hush* ðŸ˜¯
